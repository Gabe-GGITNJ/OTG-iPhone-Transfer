# OTG-iPhone-Photo & File Transfer
Manually Transferring Photos

## Overview

I misplaced my data transfer cable and needed a way to backup my pictures on my iPhone
I also didn’t want to upload to the cloud since it would take while using data. And the WiFi that was available was for public use and not very safe. 
So I grabbed my USB Thumb Drive and my adapter
